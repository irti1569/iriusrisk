## Design Choices, Technologies Used, Considerations for Future Scalability
Given the limited scope of the project, I chose to use FLASK as my REST framework as it is a lightweight framework that can quickly spin up a server for use. I was able to quickly setup my endpoints and create an MVP. I chose to use SUMY as it is a popular and easy to use library for text summarization. It is widely used, has over 3000 stars on GitHub and is kept up to date and is actively being developed and maintained. With regards to scalability,I split the code into smaller packages to make it easier to add additional views as needed without cluttering up the main file to setup and run the server. I followed best practices on using Blueprint to link the views to the main application to make it easier to add or remove views as needed. I added a basic config file to be used to configure settings such as the name of the application or how many sentences the summary must generate. This can be expanded to include more config as needed. I also added tests using pytest to ensure that the views are tested before being deployed to minimize the risk of deploying broken code. Scalability was considered from ab outside perspective, with the view that multiple iterations of this service can be spun up using kubernetes pods to handle high loads.
